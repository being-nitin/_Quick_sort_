	   For worst case the time complexity is o(n^2).
	   Best case means the pivot is the mid element so that it divides the array in two halves. And at the
	   correct index too. So the time complexity will be o(nlogn).
	   Worst case means the pivot which we have selected is the max element or min element,
	   that means a part of the array is vacant.That is the value of k =0. so the time complexity
	   will be o(n^2).
